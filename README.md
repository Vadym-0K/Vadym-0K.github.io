This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a back-end software developer. The site is designed to present my experience, skills, and current projects. I used a skeleton repo from [codewithsadee's vCard personal portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio.git) and modified it to fit my personal brand and style.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is optimized for viewing on any device, from mobile to desktop.
- **Project Showcase**: Includes details about my projects, skills, and the technologies I specialize in.
- **Contact Information**: Visitors can reach out via email or social media links.
- **About Me Section**: Overview of my background, skills, and what I'm currently working on.

## What I Modified
- Replaced all placeholder content with my personal information, including:
  - My name, email, and location.
  - Custom description about my experience and skillset.
  - Details about the services I offer, such as software design, testing, documentation, and creating models and diagrams.
  - Updated all the icons and imagery to reflect my personal brand.
  
- Tweaked the UI/UX for a better user experience.
